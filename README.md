# WHAT
Pick the Pickle is a game about catching pickles and not getting stabbed in the jar by knives. It requires [pyglet][1], which doesn't work on newer versions of OS X, but oh well!!!

# HOW
Get [pyglet][1], then get download the game by doing something like this:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/grampajoe/pickle.git
```

And run it like this:
```sh
cd pickle
./pickle.py
```

The objective is to fill jars with pickles before they're broken by the falling knives. Why are there falling knives? I don't know, why are there falling pickles?

# WHY
Pick the Pickle is an exercise in a few things:

* *Making a game.* I'd never really done that before, and I certainly hadn't done any graphics programming. I got started with [this Python OpenGL tutorial][2].
* *Releasing something.* I wanted to make something to put out into the world.
* *Not being "done" with something.* Too many of my projects are gathering dust because I don't want people to see them before they've reached the impossible "done" state.

# OKAY
Yep.
